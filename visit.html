                    <p class="text-faded mb-4">While we would love to show off the farm, we simply do not have the time
                        and are not set up to provide private tours during working farm hours. We are a working farm,
                        every minute of the day is planned. Our farm is full of hazards, we are not child proofed, and
                        someone could easily get hurt in the blink of an eye. When you come to our Farm Front Porch
                        Market Hours, there are ropes and cones blocking off areas of the farm for this reason. Please
                        do not enter blocked off areas when coming to pick up your products. We are only open for tours
                        through Airbnb Experiences, or during our Farm Days. For more information about our Airbnb
                        Experiences and Farm Days, visit our <a class="orange-background-link" target="_blank"

                        Please pull into the barn driveway and PARK ON YOUR IMMEDIATE LEFT! It will be the second one on

                        vehicle, block the driveway, or park off our property. If there is a lot of traffic, please
                        follow the instructions of the parking attendant.

                        You can walk through the wooden entry gate on the FAR right. When you come to our Farm Front
                        Porch Market Hours, there are ropes and cones blocking off areas of the farm for a reason.
                        Please do not enter blocked off areas when coming to pick up your products. We ask that you walk
                        up to the barn front porch where you can ring the bell (yes, a literal bell) and someone will
                        come to help you.

                        Please do not let your children loose! There are many hazards on the farm and it would break our
                        hearts if anything happened. We have no liability insurance so enter at your own risk!
                        Unattended children will be gifted with two kittens, a super large Mountain Dew and allowed to
                        climb the manure pile! Just kidding, but you catch the drift…

                        The walking tour starts at the duck enclosure (they are up front) and continues with a look at
                        our prize-winning chickens! You will learn about the various breeds and why we have them
                        (production and show) and we will show you how we gather eggs from the nests. Next, we will
                        continue to the barn area where we will first visit with our dry stock (non-milking). I will
                        explain the different breeds of goats, their origins, and show the difference between our dry
                        goats and our milking line. Guests will be allowed to pet the animals and we will supply animal
                        cookies for you to feed them. You will have the opportunity to pet, snuggle and love on the
                        goats.

                    <p class="text-faded mb-4">
                        From time to time there are baby goats, ducks, chicks, and bunnies. We cannot plan what we will
                        have at any one time, but we foster cats so most of the time there are kittens to see. If we
                        have baby goats, guests can learn to bottle feed the babies if they wish. Guests will view the
                        milking parlor and we will explain how we produce the milk from beginning to end. The tour will
                        conclude with a sampling of fresh artisan cheese made here on the farm! The tour lasts
                        approximately 2 hours, with the last 20 minutes spent sampling our various goat cheeses and
                        products.
